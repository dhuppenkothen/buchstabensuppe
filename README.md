# buchstabensuppe

Buchstabensuppe is a project that aims to detect quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) 
in X-ray data from black-hole binaries using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC).

The idea is that using ABC and birth/death reversible-jump MCMC, we can compute a 
posterior distribution for the presence of a QPO, and not bother with all that 
frequentist p-value significance nonsense.
